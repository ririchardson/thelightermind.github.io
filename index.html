            <p>
                Please note that while the term “therapy” is used on this site to describe my hypnotherapy and meditation services, I am not a licensed therapist. I facilitate sessions aimed at personal growth, relaxation, and well-being using various hypnotherapy techniques and complementary modalities. 
                The sessions I offer may support your healing and relaxation journey, and are not meant to replace a professional medical diagnosis and treatment or advice. For hypnotherapy sessions designed to support any health condition (medical, dental or psychological) a referral, prescription, or direction from a licensed healthcare provider is required. 
                While hypnotherapy can be powerful, individual results cannot be guaranteed. Your success depends on your personal commitment and willingness to change.

                                craving or gravitating towards healthier food choices naturally, rather than forcing diet
                                changes. After just 2 sessions I noticed I had more energy and felt healthier and happier.
                                The weight is beginning to fall off."

                    <p class="text">
                        A: While there is no special preparation for a hypnosis session, there are some do’s and don’ts and a few tips for success:</p><p class="text" style="font-size: 1em;margin-left: 3em">
                            - Make sure you are not driving or are in a situation where your attention is required when starting your zoom session.<br><br>
                            - Enjoy a relaxed routine before the session to be in a relaxed state (e.g. go for a short walk or meditate).<br><br>
                            - Avoid coffee (unless it's your usual routine in the morning), avoid alcohol, and eat light.<br><br>
                            - Wear comfortable clothes and try to ensure you won’t get interrupted during the session.<br><br>
                            - Keep an open mind - set a clear intention for the session and keep in mind you get out of it what you put into it.

                    <h2>Q: How long will it take to lose weight after weight loss hypnotherapy?</h2>
                    <p class="text">
                        A: The exact amount of time depends on each client as the reasons and habits are different for each person. In many cases, results are noticeable after a few sessions.
